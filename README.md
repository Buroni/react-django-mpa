# react-django-mpa

Uses a simple `Message` data model with `messages` app, which displays messages in a list or detail view at routes `messages/` and `messages/<pk>` respectively. 

## Setup
In the repo root directory, install dependencies:
```
npm i --dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Django project:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Run the webpack bundler:
```
npm run watch
```

## How Pages are Served

* `messages/static/js/components`: Stores the React components needed to be compiled and used by the app.
* `messages/static/js/pages`: Each page of the app is stored here in its own file. Each page uses `ReactDOM.render` to render a component in `components/` as the root component of the page, and pass `window.props` (originally data from Django) into the component. These page files can be loaded inside a HTML template after being bundled. Each page has its own React root, unlike an SPA which has one root branching into the whole application.
* `webpack.config.js`: The `entry` export in this file contains the entry points for all the pages in the application. The entry points in this example are the files inside `pages/`

So in order to create a new page in the app, first the React component for that page is put inside `components/ReactComponentName.js`. Then the React render code is placed in `pages/reactComponentName.js` and the page file is added as an entry point in `webpack.config.js`.

## Interface between Django and Webpack/React

* Each Django view which is to pass data into a displayed React component should use the `ReactMixin`. This mixin attaches the props to be passed into the react component onto the `context` object, alongside the name of the webpack bundle to be loaded and some page metadata. 
* The `ReactMixin` uses the `base.html` template, which loads the bundle using `django-webpack-loader` based on the `page_name` specified by the view component. In this template, the react props provided by the view's context are also attached to `window.props`, ready to be injected into the component by `pages/componentName` as mentioned in the previous section.

## Screenshots
The blue navigation bar is a static element inside the base template (not a React component). The message list below the bar is a React component.

## Todo
* Add Typescript and SCSS support.
* Figure out what to do with MobX in an MPA, since there's no longer a global app state when each component is being served independently. MobX may not be appropriate any more, since state would be handed into the component through an API call rather than through a FE data model.
* Review our use of lifecycles and web APIs. Lifecycles work differently in SSR React, and the latter isn't available in SSR. See https://itnext.io/tips-for-server-side-rendering-with-react-e42b1b7acd57
